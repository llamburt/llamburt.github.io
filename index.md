## My Project list: ##
* Mockingbird: a collection of agents (micro-services) to generate test FIXML messages (such as MockPrimeBroker, MockSecurityMaster, etc)
* SmoothOperator: a Web dashborad to control instances of MockPrimeBroker app (and other micro-services) to generate variable test loads
* AdaptiveForgeLite:  a simplified version that parses and normalizes trade data
